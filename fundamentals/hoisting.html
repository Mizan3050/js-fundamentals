    // Hoisting - Hoisting is a phenomenon in javascript where we are able to access the variable and functions even before their initialization
    // functions are stored as the entire functions itself, var is assigned value undefined
    // How functions are executed

    var x = 1;
    a();
    b();
    console.log(1);

    function a() { // local execution context will be created for function a where value of x will be limited to the function scope only
      x = 10;
      console.log(x);
    }

    function b() { // local execution context will be created for function b where value of x will be limited to the function scope only
      x = 100;
      console.log(x);
    }

    // Output
    // 10
    // 100
    // 1

    // explain what an execution context, what is a call stack, how memory allocation and code execution takes place

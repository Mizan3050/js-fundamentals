    // Lexical Scope - Whenever an execution context is created a lexical env is created,
    // It comprises of local memory and a reference of lexical environment of its parents.
    // Whenever a variable is encountered during execution, it is first searched in the local memory space,
    // if not found then it goes to the lexical scope of its parent and performs the step.
    // this step is performed until found or reaches global space.

    // The chaining of lexical env to find a particular variable is called scope chaining.
